## What is `git`?

- A system that keeps records of your changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made which changes and when
- Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state
- Isn't the only VCS, but probably the best

---

## How does `git` work?

- Essentially records what all your files look like at a given point in time
- You decide when to take a snapshot, and of what files
- Have the ability to go back to visit any snapshot
- Your snapshots from later on will stay around, too

---

### What is a repo?

- A collection of all the files and the history of those files
- Consists of all your commits
- Can live on a local machine or on a remote server (GitHub!)

---

- The act of copying a repository from a remote server is called cloning
- The process of downloading commits that donâ€™t exist on your machine from a remote repository is called pulling changes
- The process of adding your local changes to the remote repository is called pushing changes

---

## More importantly, what is GitHub?

- Largest web-based git repository hosting service
- _remote repositories_ Allows for code collaboration with anyone online
- Adds extra functionality on top of git
- UI, documentation, bug tracking, feature requests, pull requests, and more!

### Pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.
