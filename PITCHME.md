## What is `git`?

- A system that keeps records of your changes
- Allows for collaborative development
- Allows you to know who made what changes and when
- Allows you to revert any changes and go back to a previous state
- Isn't the only VCS, but probably the best

---

## How does `git` work?

- Essentially records what all your files look like at a given point in time
- You decide when to take a snapshot, and of what files
- Have the ability to go back to visit any snapshot
- Your snapshots from later on will stay around, too

### What is a repo?

- Often shortened to ‘repo’
- A collection of all the files and
- the history of those files
- Consists of all your commits
- Can live on a local machine or on a remote server (GitHub!)
- The act of copying a repository from a remote server is called cloning
- The process of downloading commits that don’t exist on your machine from a remote repository is called pulling changes
- The process of adding your local changes to the remote repository is called pushing changes

## What is Github?

- Largest web-based git repository hosting service
- _remote repositories_ Allows for code collaboration with anyone online
- Adds extra functionality on top of git
- UI, documentation, bug tracking, feature requests, pull requests, and more!
